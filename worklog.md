# Day 1

- Starting from the partcile code I already coded
- Add transition, tune, cursor
- Add reveal, click handler
- Style the player a bit

# Day 2

A Flare war.

- Cloudflare could simply content type automagically. So it would a dizz file is in fact an ogg media
- But it does not
- So it adds the headers. But as octet stream, why go figure. Why stream, for download?
- So it streams
- But no range jump, cannot configure that sadely
- I gave up, I put tune on Vimeo
- Embedded hidden player, control to move forward and backward


# Leason learnt

- Cloudflare is great, but could be even better
- Vimeo, is the best centralized video hosting platform
- There are funny names out there
